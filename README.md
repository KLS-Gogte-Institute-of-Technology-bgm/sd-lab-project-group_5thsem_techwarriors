# Bus Reservation System

This is a retired college assignment I made in 2017, for my Web Programming Lab (15CS55P, [DTE Karnataka](http://dte.kar.nic.in/indexe.shtml?en)). 
It uses Apache, phpMyAdmin and MySQL.

### Try it out:

<b>OR</b>
Download the zip and extract it to ```http``` or ```www``` folder of your AMP installation.

2. Go to ```localhost/busreservationsystem/welcome.html``` in your web browser.
