# BookMyBus

BookMyBus aims to maintain transport companiesâ€™ processes online automatically. It deals with booking and transport maintenance, which is very tedious to look after these particulars to complete the  task at the right time. The system not only deals with transporters owned vehicles but also takes into consideration about the other types of transport vehicles available with other transporters and drivers.

Customers must be able to take a print out of their e-tickets. At the back end, the administrator is  able to manage the trips, ticket rates, coach seating, discounts and also can generate trip sheet with passenger details. The passenger details must possess passport details, age eligibility, etc. Thus, BookMyBus was made.
