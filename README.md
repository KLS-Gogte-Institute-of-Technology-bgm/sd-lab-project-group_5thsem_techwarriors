# Bus Reservation System

This is a college assignment we made in 2020, for our Software Design Lab (18CSL58, [GIT](http://git.edu)). 
It uses Apache, phpMyAdmin and MySQL (AMP).

### Try it out:

1. Clone this project, open Terminal in your ```http``` or ```www``` folder of your AMP installation and type:<br>
```git clone https://github.com/KLS-Gogte-Institute-of-Technology-bgm/sd_group_33_TechWarriors```
<b>OR</b>
Download the zip and extract it to ```http``` or ```www``` folder of your AMP installation.

2. Go to ```localhost/busreservationsystem/welcome.html``` in your web browser.


<b>Tip</b>: To quickly set up the required database, open the ```dbcreator.php``` file in your web browser.
